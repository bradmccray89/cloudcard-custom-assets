# cloudcard-custom-assets
Contains the template and assets used to customize CloudCard for our customers. 

# Instructions

To customize a new organization, create a directory for them under `organizations`. Make a copy of the template, and update it as instructed in the file itself. Use the org's directory to store any logos needed.

When setting up the organization in CloudCard, put the link to the github pages version of the file or image url boxes. For example: `https://sharptopco.github.io/cloudcard-custom-assets/organizations/lehman/cloudcard-lehman.css` for the Lehman College custom css file. For another organization or for a logo, the following should stay the same: `https://sharptopco.github.io/cloudcard-custom-assets/organizations/`.
