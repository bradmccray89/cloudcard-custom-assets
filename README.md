# Instructions

To customize a new organization, create a directory for them under `organizations`. Make a copy of the template, and update it as instructed in the file itself. Use the org's directory to store any logos needed.

When setting up the organization in CloudCard, put the link to the "raw" version of the file into either the custom css or image url boxes.
